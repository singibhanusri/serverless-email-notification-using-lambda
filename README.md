# serverless-email-notification-using-lambda
Serverless email notifications using AWS Lambda involve setting up a system where you send email notifications without managing server infrastructure. Here's a brief overview:

1. **Trigger**: An event, such as a new item in an S3 bucket or a message in an SNS topic, triggers an AWS Lambda function.
2. **Lambda Function**: The Lambda function processes the event and generates the email content.
3. **Email Sending**: The Lambda function uses AWS Simple Email Service (SES) or another email-sending service to send the email.
4. **Configuration**: You configure the Lambda function with appropriate permissions and environment variables to handle email sending and event processing.

This setup allows you to handle email notifications efficiently and scale automatically based on demand without managing the underlying servers.
